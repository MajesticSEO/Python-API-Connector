Python-API-Connector
====================

The Python Connector has been developed using Python 2.7.2.

see GetBackLinkdata.py GetIndexData.py and OpenAppGetIndexItemInfo.py files as examples of how to use these connectors 
to run the examples have python 2+ installed, then in terminal use  >py GetBackLinkData this will run the script.\
note: using the python command will not run the command.

you need only import from  APIService.py in majesticseo_external_rpc directory  
we hope this helps.

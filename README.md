Python-API-Connector (for Python 2.7.0)
====================

Majestic速 surveys and maps the Internet and has created the largest commercial Link Intelligence database in the world. The Majestic速 search engine is mainly used to instantly provide Flow Metrics速 which evaluate the quality of any page on the Internet on a scale from 0 to 100. The connector libraries are supplied to assist in using the Majestic速 API and are available in a number of programming languages.
 
Setup
---------------
Clone this repository in a directory. 

Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to the Python-API-Connector directory.
This allows Python to find the library and import it from your project.

On Windows you can use the `set` command:
```
set PYTHONPATH=C:\project\lib\Python-API-Connector
```
On linux use the `export` command instead: 
```
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/project/lib/Python-API-Connector
```
Examples
-------------
There are a few examples of using the API-Connector in the following scripts:

* GetIndexItemInfo.py 
  * The GetIndexItemInfo command provides data on the number of backlinks to any web page or site, linking domains and the main topics for that page or website
* GetBackLinkData.py 
  * GetBacklinkData will return rows of data with information about all the pages linking to a given URL or domain
  
The follwoing code is from GetIndexItemInfo.py and shows how the API-Connector can be used:

```
api_service = APIService(app_api_key, endpoint)
response = api_service.execute_command('GetIndexItemInfo', parameters)
```

Further notes  
------------------
The Python Connector has been developed using Python 2.7.2.
To run the examples have python 2+ installed, then in terminal use ```python2 somefile.py```  
On your system the command might instead be ```py somefile.py```.

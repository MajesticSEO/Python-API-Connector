Python-API-Connector
====================
The API-Connector is a library that helps provides some useful tools for interfacing with the API  
 
See GetBackLinkdata.py GetIndexData.py and OpenAppGetIndexItemInfo.py files as examples of how to use these connectors.\

>For set up:

On Windows set PYTHONPATH in the Environmental Variables to Python-API-connector directory ie. add C:\project\lib\Python-API-Connector to the PYTHONPATH variable. This will be helpfull as then you can import in the library from another directory other wise it will cause issues with imports.

On linux, in the terminal it will look somthing like this: 
```
set PYTHONPATH=/usr/project/lib/Python-API-Connector
```

>Note: The Python Connector has been developed using Python 2.7.2.\
>To run the examples have python 2+ installed, then in terminal use >python2 somefile.py  
>This will run the script or try py to run the file.
>you need only import from  APIService.py in majesticseo_external_rpc directory
